## How to Calculate Your Potential ROI

Use this framework to estimate your own returns:

### Step 1: Define Your Baseline Metrics
```
Current monthly revenue: $________
Current CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $________
Current conversion rate: ________%
Current customer lifetime value: $________
Marketing team hours/month: ________
```

### Step 2: Project Conservative Improvements
Based on industry averages, apply these conservative estimates:
- Revenue increase: +15-25%
- CAC reduction: -20-35%
- Conversion rate: +30-50%
- Team productivity: +40-60%

### Step 3: Calculate Annual Impact
```
Revenue increase = Baseline revenue × Improvement %
Cost savings = (CAC reduction + Time saved) × Volume
Total return = Revenue increase + Cost savings
ROI = (Total return - Investment) / Investment × 100
```

### Example Calculation:

**Baseline:**
- Monthly revenue: $100,000
- CAC: $150
- New customers/month: 100
- Marketing team: 3 people @ $60/hour

**Conservative Projections:**
- Revenue: +20% = +$240,000/year
- CAC: -25% = $3,750/month saved = $45,000/year
- Time saved: 120 hours/month × $60 = $86,400/year

**Investment:**
- Implementation: $50,000
- Annual costs: $30,000
- Total: $80,000

**ROI Calculation:**
- Total returns: $371,400
- ROI: ($371,400 - $80,000) / $80,000 = **364%**
